Final Project for Web Game Development

### Description
Game will consist of two or more players inside of a 3D cube (maybe with some obstacles inside) whose faces wrap around to one another. 
Players can move in all directions and could shoot balls of various sizes and speeds (dependent on their mana and how quickly it recharges) , but the balls will slow down pretty quickly and come to a stop in the arena. 
It is hard to straight up hit someone with a ball since they are all pretty slow compared to the player but as the match goes on more enemy balls will litter the arena, so player movement slowly gets restricted. A match ends when only one player remains.
 The core of the gameplay revolves around strategically blocking off other players movement with your own shots as well as trick shotting them through the walls.
